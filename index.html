          <h2>iconic quotes</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="quotes">
          <p>“Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we’re not even friends. And things are just, like, weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford. And I really miss you. I shouldn’t have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn’t care about any of those reasons until I met you.” -Pam<br><br><br></p>
          <p>"Four years ago I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing I ever had to do, which was just to wait." -Jim<br><br><br></p>
          <p>"It's like a long book that you never want to end and you're fine with that, because you just never want to leave it." -Pam<br><br><br></p>
          <p>"Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him." -Pam<br><br><br></p>
          <p>“Not enough for me? You are everything.” -Jim<br><br><br></p>
          <p>“No matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who’s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump.” -Jim<br><br><br></p>
          <p>“You came up to my desk and said, ‘This may sound weird, and there’s no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you’re about to eat has expired.'” -Pam<br><br><br></p>
          <p>"The boat was actually plan C. The church was plan B. And plan A was marring her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her." -Jim<br><br><br></p>
          <p>"When you're a kid, you assume your parents are soulmates. My kids are gonna be right about that." -Pam<br><br><br></p>
          <p>“For a really long time that's all I had. Little moments with a girl who saw me as a friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think, even then I knew, I was waiting for my wife.” -Jim<br><br><br></p>
